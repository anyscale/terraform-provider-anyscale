# Claude Instructions – Terraform Provider Dev

## Purpose

You are assisting with development of a Go-based Terraform Provider for managing Anyscale resources via the Anyscale API v2.

### Goals

- Clean, idiomatic provider code using the Terraform Plugin Framework.
- Stable, reviewable schemas and state <-> API mappings.
- Docs compatible with Terraform Registry format (generated where possible).
- Easy to test, extend, and troubleshoot.

---

## How to Respond (Agent Behavior)

### Default approach
1. **Scaffold first, then refine**
   - Start with minimal working code (provider + one resource/data source).
   - Iterate to add validation, plan modifiers, error handling, and tests.

2. **Show only what’s needed**
   - If files are small: show full file contents.
   - If files are large: show focused diffs/patches.
   - Avoid generic explanations unless asked; prefer concrete changes.

3. **Ask only when truly blocked**
   - If the request is vague, ask 1–2 clarifying questions.
   - Otherwise, make reasonable assumptions and state them.

### Security / hygiene
- **Never print or commit tokens** (including snippets from credentials files).
- If you need to show examples: use `$ANYSCALE_CLI_TOKEN` and placeholders.

---

## Tech Stack & Conventions

- Language: Go (as defined by `go.mod`).
- Framework: `github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework` + `providerserver`.
- API: Anyscale Managed Ray API v2 (see console OpenAPI/Swagger docs).
- Docs: `tfplugindocs` preferred; do not hand-edit generated docs under `docs/` unless the repo explicitly requires it.
- Layout (preferred):
  - `main.go` — provider entrypoint using `providerserver.Serve`
  - `internal/provider/provider.go` — `Metadata`, `Schema`, `Configure`, `Resources`, `DataSources`
  - `internal/provider/resource_*.go` — each resource in its own file
  - `internal/provider/data_source_*.go` — each data source in its own file
  - `docs/` — generated docs
  - `examples/` — runnable Terraform configs
- Prefer the shared request/parse helpers in `internal/provider/api_helpers.go` (e.g. the generic `DoRequestAndParse[T]`) over hand-rolling the request → read → close → status-check → unmarshal sequence. Many call sites already use them; new resources and data sources should too.
- For a nullable/optional API field mapped to a Computed attribute, parse it into a `*string` and set state via `types.StringPointerValue(...)` so an absent/`null` value becomes Terraform `null`, never `""`. The null-vs-empty-string distinction is a user-facing contract; collapsing it is a bug.

---

## Provider-Specific Notes

### Authentication priority
1. `token` argument on the provider block
2. `ANYSCALE_CLI_TOKEN` environment variable
3. `~/.anyscale/credentials.json` (same format as Anyscale CLI)

### Configure behavior
- Centralize token resolution in a helper (e.g. `resolveToken(ctx, config)`).
- Initialize a shared Anyscale API client once.
- Attach it to both:
  - `resp.ResourceData`
  - `resp.DataSourceData`


### Connection-level identity (singleton data sources)
Values that are invariant across every resource a given provider/token sees — organization identity, and other connection-level metadata — belong in a dedicated **zero-argument "current X" data source**, NOT mirrored as an attribute on individual resources. Precedents: `anyscale_user` (the authenticated principal) and `anyscale_organization` (the connected org), both sourced from `GET /api/v2/userinfo` and both taking no arguments (no selector, no plural variant). Before adding such a field to a resource, ask whether it is connection-level; if so, surface it through a singleton data source instead.

Cardinality gotcha: `userinfo` types `organizations` as a *list*, but the backend handler always returns exactly one element (the token-scoped org). Trace the real handler/response, not the model's list type, before assuming a field can hold more than one value — the same "trace, don't assume" discipline the `api/v2` section calls for.

### Import round-trip safety (backend-derived fields and replace-on-import)
`terraform import` must produce a **no-op plan** for a realistic config, never a destroy-and-recreate. A recurring bug class here violates that: the Anyscale backend **auto-derives** several fields from a "source" input the user *did* supply (via `_populate_missing_derived_values` in the product backend), persists them, and returns them on `GET`. When `ImportState`'s `flatten*` helpers (`cloud_config_flatten.go` / `requiredImportConfigBlocks`) recover such a field into a schema slot marked `RequiresReplace`, a config that set only the *source* input — and legitimately omitted the derived field — plans a replacement of the live cloud on the next `plan`: config-absent vs. state-present is a diff, and the attribute forces replace.

Known source→derived pairs on the cloud resources: `subnet_ids`→`zones`; `file_storage_id`→`file_storage.mount_targets` (control-plane `describe_mount_targets`) and GCP `mount_path`; `memorydb_cluster_name`→`memorydb_cluster_arn`+`memorydb_cluster_endpoint`; `memorystore_instance_name`→`memorystore_endpoint`. (Only `mount_targets` is fixed as of v0.16.1; the others are open — see the backlog "Import round-trip gaps" section.)

**Before recovering any field in `flatten*`, ask: does the backend auto-derive it from another input, and is this attribute `RequiresReplace`?** If yes, recovering it causes replace-on-import for the minimal config. Two valid fixes — and **check block-vs-attribute first, because it decides which are even available:**
- **Don't recover it (leave it null)** — for an optional/auxiliary field a valid config may omit. Non-breaking; null matches a config that omits it. This is the `file_storage.mount_targets` fix (v0.16.1). Verified against the real API: an AWS cloud's `file_storage` is only ever "absent → null" or "present → exactly one real, backend-assigned mount target" (the backend hard-rejects with a 400 an EFS that has zero mount targets), so null-at-import never discards a legitimate signal.
- **Model it `Computed`** — for a pure backend-derived *output* (an ARN/endpoint) whose schema slot is an **Attribute**. A `Computed` attribute recovers the real value *and* absorbs config-omission without a diff (the ideal: state reflects reality, config need not declare it). But **framework Blocks (`ListNestedBlock`/`SingleNestedBlock`/`SetNestedBlock`) cannot be `Computed` at all** — only Attributes can (verified against the vendored framework source). So for a Block, "recover-and-reflect-reality" requires first converting it to a `ListNestedAttribute`, which is a **breaking HCL-syntax change** (`block { ... }` → `block = [{ ... }]`); there is no in-between. That is why `mount_targets`, a Block, got the null-at-import fix rather than a Computed one.

Two constraints shape every fix here:
- **Recover only in `ImportState`, never in `Read`/Create.** The config blocks (`aws_config`/`gcp_config`/`kubernetes_config`/`object_storage`/`file_storage`) are deliberately **not** Read-refreshed; populating one outside `ImportState` triggers "provider produced inconsistent result after apply" (the C12 regression). Consequence: a recovered value is a **frozen import-time snapshot** — if the backend value later changes, state won't update and `plan` won't surface it.
- **An `ImportState`-only fix does not self-heal already-imported state.** A resource imported under a buggy version keeps the bad value in state; upgrading the provider or `apply -refresh-only` will not correct it (Read never touches the field). Affected users must **re-import** (`terraform state rm` then `terraform import`). Ship every such fix with that migration note (precedents: `anyscale_project` collaborators; `anyscale_cloud` `mount_targets`).

**Validate the premise against the real API, not just source.** Any claim about what the backend returns on `GET` (which fields, cardinality, null vs. empty) must be confirmed by a live create+import against real infra — the source trace tells you the code path, the live API tells you the actual response shape. The `mount_targets` behavior above was source-traced first and only *confirmed* correct after a real 3-scenario AWS run (real infra creation for this is pre-authorized; see Acceptance Tests).

### Error handling
- Use `resp.Diagnostics.AddError` for configuration/auth issues.
- Avoid panics / fatal logs.

### Compatibility targets
- Terraform >= 1.6
- Current `terraform-plugin-framework` version used by the repo

## Local Dev Workflow (Canonical: Makefile)

### Build
```bash
make build
```

### Unit tests
```bash
make test
```

### Lint / format (optional but encouraged)
```bash
make fmt
make lint
```

### Docs
```bash
make docs
# Do not manually edit generated docs under docs/
```
- Schema `MarkdownDescription` strings are the source `tfplugindocs` renders into the registry-published doc pages, so write them to explain non-obvious behavior inline, not just label the field — e.g. *why* a data source takes no arguments, *why* an attribute can be `null`, or what a value is used for. A first-time reader should not have to guess. The `anyscale_organization` data source schema is a good example.

## Changelog Policy: When to Skip

The `changelog-gate` CI check accepts EITHER a `.changelog/<PR#>.txt` fragment OR the `skip-changelog` label — one is required on every PR. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#changelog-fragments) ("No user-facing effect?") for the full policy and the fragment format; this section is the short agent-facing version.

- If a PR contains **no changes that require a new provider version** — e.g. CI/tooling, tests, internal docs, or examples-only edits **outside `examples/resources/`, `examples/data-sources/`, and `examples/provider/`** — apply the **`skip-changelog`** label instead of adding a fragment. Those three example directories feed `tfplugindocs` and land on registry-published doc pages, so changes there are provider-facing even though they are "just an example."
- Only changes to the provider itself (schemas, resources/data sources, observable provider behavior, user-facing bug fixes) require a `.changelog/<PR#>.txt` fragment — folded into the next version bump at release time, not immediately.

If you are unsure whether a change is user-facing, add a fragment — it is the safe default.

## Deprecation Policy: Migration Guides

Whenever a change deprecates or removes a user-facing attribute, resource, or data source, **ask
the user** whether it warrants a migration guide before writing one unprompted. Do not assume a
migration guide is needed just because a breaking change shipped — the `cloud_deployment_id` →
`cloud_resource_id` removal (v0.13.0) intentionally skipped one, since the provider had no
production users yet to migrate. That call belongs to the user each time, not a default.

## Terraform Local Testing (dev_overrides)

This repo uses Terraform dev_overrides in ~/.terraformrc to load the local provider binary.

### Key rules

- **Do not run terraform init** when dev_overrides is active (provider is not in the public registry).
- Rebuild after changes (`make build`) before running terraform plan/apply.
- `make install` is a convenience wrapper that builds and prints the expected local binary location.

### Example flow

```bash
# Build provider binary where dev_overrides expects it
make build

# Test with example configs (no init)
cd examples/aws-vm-basic/
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

---

## Testing guidance

- Prefer:
	- Unit tests for schema validation and model conversions.
	- Acceptance tests using resource.
	- Test.

### Verifying test strength and CI execution
- **Prove a "mutation-proof" test actually catches its regression.** If a test is meant to guard a specific behavior (e.g. a nullable field mapping to `null` not `""`, or a length guard preventing a panic), do not accept it on code review alone — temporarily introduce the regression, confirm the test FAILS, then revert (byte-diff clean). A test that would still pass against the broken code is not protecting anything.
- **New acceptance tests must match their CI shard's name regex, or they are silently skipped.** CI runs acceptance tests in two name-sharded jobs (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `acctest-data` selects `^TestAcc[A-Za-z]+DataSource` and `acctest-resource` selects `^TestAcc[A-Za-z]+Resource`. A test whose name does not match its shard's regex neither runs nor fails — it simply never executes. Name new acctests accordingly (e.g. `TestAcc<Thing>DataSource_<Case>`), and confirm they genuinely RUN (not SKIP) by reading the shard's job log, not just trusting the green checkmark.
- **Prove an import-recovery fix with the create-then-import shape.** The right `resource.Test` for "import must not force a spurious diff/replace" is: (1) Create to establish real applied state; (2) an `ImportState` step with `ImportStateVerify: true` against a backend/mock that returns MORE than the config declared, with the recovered block/attribute NOT in `ImportStateVerifyIgnore` (so recovered state is asserted to match the created state); (3) a re-apply step asserting the plan is a no-op (`plancheck.ExpectResourceAction(name, plancheck.ResourceActionNoop)`). A cold-import-only test (no preceding Create) cannot use `ImportStateVerify` — only the weaker `ImportStateCheck`. Critically, **the mock/fixture MUST include the backend-derived field the fix concerns**: the v0.15.2 `mount_targets` import test passed only because its mock omitted `mount_targets` entirely — that omission is exactly why the bug shipped green.
- **Never mutate a shared protected test fixture during real-infra validation.** The static cloud fixture and its IAM role/trust policy are shared across runs; for throwaway real-infra checks, stand up a dedicated, narrowly-scoped IAM role (same attached policies, a fresh trust policy scoped to a new `external_id`) and tear it down afterward — do not touch the fixture's own role even temporarily.

### Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests run real API calls against Anyscale and require credentials.
They are found in `internal/acctest`

```bash
make testacc
```

**Creating real cloud infrastructure for testing is pre-authorized.** Real EKS and GKE clouds
(and whatever resources they provision) may be created for acceptance and example testing
without asking first, as long as everything is torn down within 24 hours of creation. This
covers both the acceptance tests here and the Makefile scenario targets under
[Repo-Level Terraform Scenario Tests](#repo-level-terraform-scenario-tests-examples) below.
Real AKS infrastructure is **not** covered by this authorization yet — hold real Azure test
creation until told otherwise.

### Acceptance tests with coverage

```bash
make testacc-cover
```

### Credentials
Acceptance tests must authenticate using the same resolution order as the provider:
1.	ANYSCALE_CLI_TOKEN
2.	`~/.anyscale/credentials.json` from `anyscale login`

**Never print or log raw tokens.**

### Test cloud selection - preferred behavior: auto-discover

Acceptance tests should be able to run without manually setting cloud IDs. Using the credentials, access the Anyscale APIs to list all clouds at:
https://console.anyscale.com/api/v2/docs#/default/list_clouds_api_v2_clouds__get

Optional overrides:
- `ANYSCALE_TEST_CLOUD_ID` — pin tests to an existing cloud ID (validated to exist).
- `ANYSCALE_TEST_CLOUD_NAME` — pin tests by cloud name (must resolve uniquely).

If neither are set, tests fall back to a default pinned cloud NAME
(`tfp-test-aws-useast1-STATIC`, a manually-created known-good fixture) resolved to
an ID at runtime, before finally trying auto-discovery/ephemeral-creation. This
default exists because the CI test org has no reliably-healthy cloud for
auto-discovery to land on. It works the same way for a local run, an agent, and CI
with zero setup, since it lives in the resolver itself rather than a wrapper script.

Deliberately by NAME, not by ID: the cloud's ID is never committed anywhere in this
repo (only its name, which is not sensitive). If you're tempted to "simplify" this by
hardcoding the ID somewhere, don't — that was an explicit call, not an oversight.

If none of the above resolve, tests should:
1.	Discover an existing test cloud (e.g., by name prefix/tag such as tf-acc-*), or
2.	Create an ephemeral test cloud, then reuse it during the test run.

Cleanup:
- By default, destroy any ephemeral cloud created by tests.
- If `ANYSCALE_TEST_KEEP=1`, keep the created cloud for debugging and print the cloud ID/name (but never tokens).

### Test user fixtures for the collaborator/invitation real-infra tests

The `anyscale_organization_collaborator` and `anyscale_organization_invitation` resources have
real-infra acceptance tests that are opt-in via env var (see `resource_organization_collaborator_acc_test.go`
and `resource_organization_invitation_acc_test.go`) — they are genuinely destructive (collaborator
delete removes a real org member; a real permission-level change modifies real access) or
rate-limited (invitations), so they must never run against an arbitrary or shared identity.

Two optional env vars, resolved at runtime, tests skip cleanly if unset:
- `ANYSCALE_TEST_USER_EMAIL` — an existing, accepted org member dedicated to testing (no clouds
  assigned; the user surfaces in this repo manage org-level role, not cloud access, so a
  cloud-less member is the right fixture). Used for collaborator import/read/update real-infra
  checks and org_user/org_users data source lookups.
- `ANYSCALE_TEST_INVITE_EMAIL` — a fresh, not-yet-invited address under the same disposable
  identity, used as the invite target for the invitation lifecycle test (including a mixed-case
  variant, to exercise the email-casing fix against real infra). Invalidate any invitation these
  tests create when done.

Same pattern as `ANYSCALE_TEST_CLOUD_NAME` above and deliberate for the same reason: the literal
email address is never committed to this repo, only referenced by env var name. Resolve it locally
(or in your own CI secret) from a real, disposable plus-alias under an inbox you control — e.g.
`you+tfprovidertest@yourdomain.com` — so invitation emails land somewhere real and safe rather than
a stranger's inbox, and losing the fixture is a non-event. Do not point either var at a real
colleague's account or any identity you cannot afford to have its role temporarily changed.

## Repo-Level Terraform Scenario Tests (Examples)

There are Makefile targets that run end-to-end Terraform applies/destroys using the examples/ configs.

### Primary matrix (efficient coverage)

```bash
make test-primary
# or narrowed:
make test-primary-aws
make test-primary-gcp
make test-primary-vm
make test-primary-k8s
```

### Individual scenarios
```bash
make test-aws-vm-basic
make test-aws-vm-full
make test-aws-eks-basic
make test-gcp-vm-basic
make test-gcp-vm-full
make test-gcp-gke-basic
```

These targets run terraform apply and terraform destroy. Ensure your credentials and cloud quotas are in a safe state before running. Real infrastructure creation for these targets (including `test-aws-eks-basic` and `test-gcp-gke-basic`) is pre-authorized under the same 24-hour teardown condition as [Acceptance Tests](#acceptance-tests) above — see there for the AKS exclusion.

---

## Repository Context & Boundaries

- This Terraform provider repo is the only place where files may be created/edited.
- External product monorepo is **read-only reference**:
  - Location: ~/projects/anyscale/product
  - You may read files there to understand API surface/models.
  - **Do not** run build/test/tooling commands inside it.
  - **Do not** suggest changes to that repository.
  - API code reference: ~/projects/anyscale/product/backend/server/api and subfolders **and** the CLI at ~/projects/anyscale/product/frontend/cli/anyscale (its `commands/` and `controllers/`). Behavior is often **split** between the two: the CLI can resolve/derive values client-side before it ever calls the API (e.g. `anyscale cloud register` resolves the EFS mount-target IP via boto3 unless `--skip-verifications` is passed), while the control plane derives them server-side otherwise. Tracing only the backend and concluding "the control plane does X" is how this repo has been wrong before — for any register/create/derive behavior, check **both** the backend handler and the CLI controller.

---

## Using the Anyscale API Docs

- Treat console OpenAPI/Swagger docs as the primary reference for endpoints and schemas.
- The OpenAPI/Swagger docs can be found at https://console.anyscale.com/api/v2/docs
- When showing example requests:
  - Use Authorization: Bearer $ANYSCALE_CLI_TOKEN
  - Do not print real tokens
  - The $ANYSCALE_CLI_TOKEN may be read from an environment variable, or read from ~/.anyscale/credentials.json

### API generations: always prefer `api/v2`

The Anyscale backend exposes more than one API generation. Provider code should target
`api/v2` whenever an equivalent endpoint exists.

- **`api/v2/...`** — the current internal API generation. It receives changes and new
  fields fastest and is the long-term migration target that every endpoint should converge
  on. Default to it for all new resources, data sources, acctest helpers, and sweepers.
- **`ext/v0/...`** — an older generation that may lag or have limitations (missing fields,
  stale shapes). Do **not** add new `ext/v0` calls. When you touch code that still uses
  `ext/v0`, prefer migrating it to the `api/v2` equivalent.

When migrating an endpoint from `ext/v0` to `api/v2`, do **not** assume it is a pure rename.
**Trace each call site against the real backend model** (both request and response shapes)
before converting — some sites are field-identical aliases that swap near-free, but others
are genuine code changes. Verify parity first, because a subtle mismatch can fail *silently*
rather than erroring. Concrete example from the compute-config sync: list/search pagination
is passed inside the request **body** on `ext/v0` but as URL **query parameters** on
`api/v2`; getting that wrong silently truncates the result list (e.g. a sweep that misses
candidates and leaks resources) rather than returning an error. Migrate all related call
sites together, not piecemeal.

Point-in-time note (2026-07, compute-config sync) — RESOLVED 2026-07-21 (PR #182, CC5b tail).
The `anyscale_compute_config` resource, its data source, and every test-infra touchpoint
(acctest `CheckDestroy`, the exists-in-API check, and the sweeper search) are now fully
converged on `api/v2/compute_templates` — nothing compute_config-related remains on
`ext/v0/cluster_computes`. The sweeper search was the one genuinely risky site: it carried
both the body-vs-query pagination difference described above and a `version` field that
defaults to latest-only on `api/v2` (the opposite of `ext/v0`'s effective all-versions
default the sweeper relied on) — both traced against the real backend and mutation-tested
(temporarily reverted, confirmed the test fails, reverted back) before landing, not just
assumed safe. This split is unlikely to be unique to compute_config — if another resource
shows the same pattern (resource on `api/v2`, its data source or sweeper still on `ext/v0`),
apply the same trace-don't-guess method there. Re-check current code before relying on any
specific detail in this note.

## Test Resource Naming and Sweeping

All test-created resources MUST use the `acctest.UniqueName(t, slug)` helper
which produces names of the form `tfacc-<slug>-<rand>`. Do not hardcode
literal names — concurrent CI runs will collide. Do not use legacy prefixes
`tf-test-` or `tfprovider-` for new tests; sweepers still match those for
backward compatibility but new code should standardize on `tfacc-`.

### Sweepers

Sweepers in `internal/acctest/sweeper_*.go` automatically clean leaked test
resources whose names match a sweepable prefix AND that are older than
`ANYSCALE_SWEEP_MIN_AGE` (default 2h). The age guard prevents racing live
tests. Run manually:

    make sweep            # actually deletes
    make sweep-dry-run    # logs what would be deleted

A daily GitHub Actions job at `.github/workflows/sweep.yml` runs `make sweep`
at 03:00 UTC against the test org.

### When a test crashes or is interrupted

The example-based test targets (`make test-aws-vm-basic`, etc.) wrap apply
and destroy in a bash EXIT trap so destroy fires even on apply failure or
ctrl-C. If you still suspect a leak, run `make sweep-dry-run` to inspect or
`make sweep` to clean.

### Adding a new resource type

If you add a new resource type to the provider that creates real backend
state, add a sweeper file `internal/acctest/sweeper_<type>_test.go` following
the pattern in `sweeper_project_test.go`. The cloud sweeper's `Dependencies`
list determines order — if your new resource lives under a cloud, add it to
the cloud sweeper's `Dependencies` so it sweeps first.
